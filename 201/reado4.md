- The a<> element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.

email address in the "to" field.

a page that can be linked to

to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you 
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts.

statements together that represent a single task.
