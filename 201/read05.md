### Images
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the 
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the 
content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using 
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

### Color
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast 
between any text and the background color.
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to 
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, 
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

### Text
- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, 
weight, style, and spacing.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. 
- Text can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an 
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or 
when they have visited a link

### JPEG vs PNG vs GIF â€” which image format to use and when? 
"
- Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. 
- Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. 
- Use GIF format for images that contain animations."[1]
