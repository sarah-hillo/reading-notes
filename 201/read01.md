### How the web works

**The web server host the site somewhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.** 

**"HTML Uses Elements
to Describe the
Structure of Pages."** [1]

**"Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags."** p.29

**"Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign"** [2]
#### Escape Characters
**"There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.)
When using escape characters,
it is important to check the
page in your browser to ensure
that the correct symbol shows
up. This is because some fonts
do not support all of these
characters and you might
therefore need to specify
a different font for these
characters in your CSS code."** [3]

**"Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements."** [4] 

## PROCESS & Design
- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present [5]
