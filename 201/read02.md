HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
-  Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
-  Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
-  Attributes require a name and a value.
-  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
-  They also provide semantic information
the web.
- Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad.

-  Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not
all support the same video and audio formats, as you
need to supply your files in different formats to ensure
that everyone can see/hear them.
-  Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
-  Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. 

#### Decisions and Loops

If statements 
- If a condition is true, then run the code in that block.
If...Else statements 
- If a condition is true, then run the code in that block. Otherwise, run the code in the else block.
For loops 
- Run the code in this block based on a set number of iteration. This is known.
While loops 
- Run the code in this block while a condition is true. The number of iterations is unknown.
