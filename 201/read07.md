### Domain modeling 
"
- Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

- A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams."[1]

### Tables
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web 
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created 
with the <tr> element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells 
represented by the <td> element.

- You can make cells of a table span more than one row 
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.


### Functions, Methods, and Objects
- Functions can take parameters and may return a value. 
- An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets.
