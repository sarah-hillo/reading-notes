#### Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming
What is the hardest thing about writing code?

" There are many common answers to this question:

- Learning a new technology
- Naming things
- Testing your code
- Debugging
- Fixing bugs
- Making software maintainable" [1]

If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

- Make the problem domain easier
- Get better at understanding the problem domain

"You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem."[2]


### Object Literals
- literal nataion is the easiest way to create an object.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 

#### Document Object Model

"The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies 
how browsers should create a model of an HTML 
page and how JavaScript can access and update the 
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. " [3]

- DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, 
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
- You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass 
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 
- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one 
node, it will always return a Nadel i st. 
- From an element node, you can access and update its 
content using properties such as textContent and 
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
