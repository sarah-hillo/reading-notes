### Transforms

- With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements.
-  Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

### 2D Rotate
- The transform property accepts a handful of different values. 
- The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
- Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. 
- The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically.

### Transitions
- The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

- There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
- Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.
### Animations
- when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.
