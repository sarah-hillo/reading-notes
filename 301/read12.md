Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
	
| SQL   | NoSQL           |
| ----------     | ----------       |
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases        |   are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. |
| ----------     | ----------       |
| table based databases       |  document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. |
| ----------     | ----------       |

|  have predefined schema        |   dynamic schema for unstructured data. |
| ----------     | ----------       |

| uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful        |  queries are focused on collection of documents. |
| ----------     | ----------       |

| SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment      |  NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.  | 	 
 	 
 	 
- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?Give a real world example.
For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
 Give a real world example.
NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

- Which type of database is best for scalability?
For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
