### Functional Programming Concepts
- What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).It does not cause any observable side effects.

- What are the benefits of a pure function?
We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts.


- What is immutability?
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

- What is Referential transparency?
A function consistently yields the same result for the same input.
