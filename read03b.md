**CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.**

**CSS information can be provided from various sources.
 These sources can be the web browser, the user and the author.**

 **The information from the author can be further classified into inline, 
media type, importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition.**

**CSS style information can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document.**

 **Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; 
for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.**

**The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display.
 Declarations not set in the highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style.**
 
 **The process is called cascading.**
