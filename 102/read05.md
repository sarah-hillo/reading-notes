- An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

- Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually,
 there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and
 those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

JavaScript has the following expression categories:

Arithmetic: evaluates to a number.
String: evaluates to a character string.
Logical: evaluates to true or false. 
Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

- The this keyword is used to refer to the current object.
 (In general, this refers to the calling object in a method.)

You can use the new operator to create an instance of a user-defined 
object type or of one of the built-in object types.


- The super keyword is used to call functions on an object's parent. 
It is useful with classes to call the parent constructor.

**Loops and iteration**

- for statement:
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
 The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

- Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

- The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.
