## JavaScript function
**is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**

You can use the same code many 
times with different arguments, to produce different results.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.


Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses ()
 in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

#### JavaScript has several top-level, built-in functions:
- eval()
- uneval()
- isFinite()
- isNaN()
- parseFloat()
- parseInt()
- decodeURI()
- decodeURIComponent()
- encodeURI() 
- encodeURIComponent()
- escape()
- unescape()
 The escape sequences might be introduced by a function like escape. Because unescape() is deprecated, use decodeURI() or decodeURIComponent instead.
