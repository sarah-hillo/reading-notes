**Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.**

 **This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site
different UX designers approach the task of wireframing in different ways.Some like to draw by hand, while others like to use apps or tools found online.**

To make your wirefram:
- Do your research to use it for quick reference:carrying out analysis of similar product lines to your own,
 digging into prevailing UX trends and best practises, and, of course, reviewing your own internal design guidelines.
- have your user flow mapped out
- Draft and Skitch:Don’t think about aesthetics, don’t think about colors.
- Add some details and test.
- Turn your wireframe into prototypes:start developing your high-fidelity prototypes.

**To have a good wireframe keep the Clarity,Confidence and the simplicity.**
